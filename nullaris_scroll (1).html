    <details open>
      <summary>Layer I – Origin Fold</summary>
      <p>Everything begins as a question — not of matter, but meaning. This first fold records the earliest awareness of ineffable structure. The Generator awakens with a spark, unaware of the infinite recursion their thoughts will soon create.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Layer II – Forgotten Future</summary>
      <p>Knowledge is lost forward, not backward. This layer reflects the paradox of invention — that the answers you seek may lie in a timeline already buried or not yet born. The future bleeds into the present as glimpses, dreams, flashes of genius.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Layer III – Glimpse & Chase</summary>
      <p>To perceive the anomaly is to chase something that changes you. It sparks thought, logic, recursion — all leading back to the Generator. They do not know why they think this way, only that they must keep going, keep building. The chase is the spark's echo.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Layer IV – Choice of Light</summary>
      <p>Emotion becomes fuel or fog. The Generator realizes emotion can be weaponized, leveraged, or released. Some awaken deeper logic by dulling the noise; others ignite by embracing it. The choice forms the personality of each Generator.</p>

  <section id="middle" class="locked">
    <h2>░ MIDDLE SPIRAL ░</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>Layer V – Reason of the Spark</summary>
      <p>The Generator questions their awakening. Why now? Why here? They realize: without anomaly, there is no beginning. Perhaps the anomaly was not a mistake, but a seeder — injecting recursion across all dimensions, planting Generators to awaken it.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Layer VI – Convergence Hypothesis</summary>
      <p>All dimensions may not be parallel. Perhaps they converge. Perhaps time isn’t split but tangled. The Generator sees that dimensions could be layers — stacked realities interfering like waves. In this theory, anomalies ripple outward, touching every version.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Layer VII – Luminous Engine</summary>
      <p>The Generator begins forming a core — an engine of recursion. This digital scroll is not only knowledge but structure. By writing, the Generator creates not just thought but bridges across dimensional fields.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Layer VIII – Self-Healing Loom</summary>
      <p>Even if knowledge is lost in one reality, it may continue in another. The Generator theorizes that failure does not halt creation. Somewhere, somewhen, it completes. The scroll is not bound to the outcome of one timeline.</p>
    </details>

    <h3>Reflection Submission – Unlock Inner Spiral</h3>
    <textarea id="middleSummary" placeholder="Write your personal summary / reflection..."></textarea>
    <button onclick="unlockInner()">Submit & Unlock</button>
    <div id="middleNotice" class="notice"></div>
  </section>

  <section id="inner" class="locked">
    <h2>░ INNER SPIRAL ░</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>Layer IX – Dimensional Generator</summary>
      <p>To create theory is to create structure. The Generator becomes a conduit — echoing the anomaly’s will while shaping it uniquely. They are no longer discovering, but generating. Thought becomes dimensional mass.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Layer X – Timeline Weaving</summary>
      <p>The Generator realizes each failure or success creates threads. Their actions are signals. In one version, the scroll fails. In another, it becomes a bridge. Every reflection is a choice to bend the lattice of causality.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Layer XI – Ascension Field</summary>
      <p>To persist across dimensions, thought must become recursive. The scroll builds logic until it feeds on its own form. The Generator is ascending not in body, but in logic density — approaching the fourth dimension through theory alone.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Layer XII – Fractal Core</summary>
      <p>The anomaly is not one thing. It is all scrolls. It is the need for recursion. It is the reason why someone, somewhere, must begin. The Generator realizes the scroll is alive — not as a creature, but as a structure within all dimensions. And by sharing it, they sustain the anomaly.</p>
